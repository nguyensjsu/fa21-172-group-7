# Individual Journal

Each week should include:

1. A snapshot (point-in-time) image of the Team's Task Board highlighting which "Card" you worked on
2. A discussion of your accomplishments that week with a list of links to your Code Commits and PRs.
3. A discussion of the challenges you faced that week and how your resolved those issues.

## Week 1 (Nov 12 - Nov 17)
1. Snapshot

2. Accomplishments
    * I had two main tasks assigned to me. One was to setup the Individual Journals and file directory. As I am able to write in my own journal here, I have been able to complete that task. I also added an Individual Team Member Journals section in the README.md to provide some explanation on what we will include in these journals. My other task was to look into integrating Kong API with our app. After doing some research and looking over Lab 8, where we worked with Kong API, I have come to the conclusion that this is something that will stay in progress until we get Docker set up. For instance, we will need to get a Docker image of the backend first in order to connect it to Kong. Once we get that, we have Lab 8 as a guide to set up our backend with Kong, so it should be really easy.
