# Individual Journal

Each week should include:
1. A snapshot (point-in-time) image of the Team's Task Board highlighting which "Card" you worked on
2. A discussion of your accomplishments that week with a list of links to your Code Commits and PRs.
3. A discussion of the challenges you faced that week and how your resolved those issues.


## Week 1 (Nov 12 - Nov 17)
Initially I was in charge of brief UI mockups for the front end/front office's interface. Since I had prior experience in working in Adobe XD, that's what I used to create low-fidlity mock-ups.

It seemed like my other team members were able to replicate the mockups quite well, and I appreciate them for that. 

Here are the images for the mockups in full view:

## Week 2 (Nov 18 - Nov 23)
Messed around the the front end mostly, making a footer was not as easy as I expected, but I managed to get a decent reference from this video: https://youtu.be/g459Eia-bxw

I decided that the colorscheme for the site would just be a default blue and white. I tweaked with some of the color fonts to make this kind of color scheme, although I really wish I could have looked into ReactJS designing so it could look more visually appealing overall. 

Unfortunately I was not able to center the columns or get them to be formatted like columns. It wasn't until much later that I should have looked into the grid structure for ReactJS. While ReactJS rendering is similar to HTML programming, there were quite a few differences I was unaware of. For future reference this was a basic guide: https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP 

## Week 3 (Nov 24 - Nov 30)
Added RabbitMQ to the mix, I did end up reusing a majority of my code given from Lab 9: RabbitMQ. It originally took a couple tries to get it working but after some renaming and carefully deciding what was needed, I got it to compile at the very least. 

## Week 4 (Dec 1 - )
